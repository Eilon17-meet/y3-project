Our project's idea is a company which aims to help small bussineses to grow. Our company does it by advicing each bussiness personally, and providing them with the services and tools they need to implement.
For example, a restaurant that want to increase its amount of costumers contacts as and we evaluate the reasons why it does not have so many costumers. When we find the reason, we offer the owner possible services that will help him, like advertisement, making a website in order to be more exposed to a bigger range of potential costumers or even a new culinary trend to apply.
