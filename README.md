"BOOST"(Business Orientational Organization for Successful Thrust) is a company which aims to help small bussineses to grow. Our company does it by advicing each bussiness personally, and providing them with the services and tools they need to implement.
For example, a restaurant that wants to increase its amount of costumers contacts as and we evaluate the reasons why it does not have so many costumers. When we find the reason, we offer the owner possible services that will help him, like advertisement, making a website in order to be more exposed to a bigger range of potential costumers or even a new culinary trend to apply.
Our target is to upgrade the way our businesses permorm and the results they achieve. 
The other aspect of the company is to provide people with new options of shops, supermarket chains and a wide range of companies they do not know and thus turn their travelling experience more enjoyable. If a turist goes to a city he is not familiar with, and is searching for a coffee shop, Google maps or other travelling companies might suggest them to go only to the most famous chains and big shops but not to the traditional ones that have the posibility to offer a great experience as well.

With us, company owners and its workers  will be able to meet with a new public and grow economicaly while this public will be able to enjoy of a new variety of services and producs these stores are offering. It is a win-win game.
